                SMMEs (Small Medium Micro Enterprises) are arguably the most important types of businesses in SA 
                as they are businesses which are run by your average citizen and most are extremely friendly and homely
                .These companies also do the most to grow our economy. This is why I (Nanda Athmanandh) created Mzansi Networks
                to help SMMEs grow their business through networking with other businesses. They can find customers and suppliers as well as help eachother grow
